        ## Getting Started with Crest in 5 Minutes
        
        To get you started quickly let’s dive into the necessary steps needed to set up the environment.
        
        ### To use Crest as a Python Library
        
        #### Using Pip
        
        1. Install Crest using python package manager (Make sure pip is installed in your system).
        
        ```python 
        pip install pythoncrest
        ```

        ### To use Crest as a Service

        #### Using Conda
        
        1. Download and Install Miniconda from [conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

        2. For Windows, launch Miniconda prompt shell. For MacOS, launch the terminal.

        3. Clone the Crest repository. More details can be found at [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

        4. Go to "crest" folder in your terminal/prompt shell. Run command.
        ```python
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        conda activate crest
        ```
        
        5. Install chromedriver. The details can be found in [chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

        6. Download and Install google-chrome-stable from [ubuntuupdates.org](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/google_chrome/stable/main/base/google-chrome-stable).

        7. Once all the required libraries are installed, go to 'src/crest' folder and run the below command in your terminal/prompt shell. 
        ```python
        FLASK_APP=server.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run --port 3000 --host 0.0.0.0
        ```
        
        #### Using Docker
        
        1. Clone the repository. More details can be found at [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

        2. Download and Install docker from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Note: Make sure your docker server as well as crest image is running.

        3. Go to "crest" folder in your terminal/prompt shell. Run command.
        ```python
        docker build -t crest .
        ```
        
        4. Once the docker image is created, run it by executing the following command.
        ```python
        docker container run --name crest_container -p 3000:3000 crest 
        ```

        **Note: A machine learning model will be downloaded from [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/gargam/roberta-base-crest) when you use the Heading Analysis/ Crest Single API for the first time. It will be saved in your system's cache for future use and could take approximately 2 GB of your system's memory.**

        This API tests all focusable elements on a webpage by comparing the color contrast between the keyboard focus indicator and the component itself in its active vs. inactive states. It covers the following Issue IDs:

        **Issue ID: cr_focus_low**

        *Definition*

        When active interface controls (buttons, links, forms, page tabs, etc.) receive keyboard focus, the visual focus indicator does not meet the required color contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

        *User Impact*

        Low-vision users may have trouble seeing the visual keyboard focus indicator and may not be able to orient themselves on the page to effectively navigate content. Colorblind users may also be affected. 

        *Recommendation*

        Ensure that the visual keyboard focus indicator provides a sufficient color contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with adjacent colors (background and/or the control colors). Possible solutions include: using the CSS outline property to provide an outline around the focused element, and inverting the foreground and background colors.

        *Success Criterion*

        1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA)

        *Related Success Criteria (if applicable):*

        2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)


        More details can be found at [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.11](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html).

        **Issue ID: cr_focus_missing**

        *Definition*

        There is no visual keyboard focus indication when using TAB or SHIFT+TAB, and/or arrow keys (when applicable) to navigate through the controls (buttons, links, forms, page tabs, etc.) of the website.

        *User Impact*

        Sighted keyboard-only users are not able to orient themselves on the page and will not be able to effectively navigate content.

        *Recommendation*

        All interactive content must provide a visual indication of keyboard focus. Focus can be provided in a number of ways including change background, invert colors, border, outline, and other visual methods. Avoid the use of the "outline: none" CSS property.

        *Success Criterion*

        2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)

        *Related Success Criteria (if applicable):*

        1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (Level AA)

        This API’s task is to check for missing captions or transcripts associated with embedded videos and audio files on a webpage. It covers the following Issue IDs:

        **Issue ID: cr_transcript_missing**

        *Definition*

        Audio-only content such as podcasts and audio recordings of speeches and press conferences are not made available by transcript.

        *User Impact*

        When transcripts are provided for audio-only content, people who are deaf or deaf-blind will have access to the information visually or through the use of electronic braille.

        *Recommendation*

        Provide a transcript for audio-only content.

        *Success Criterion*

        1.2.1 Prerecorded Audio-only and Video-only (Level A)

        *Related Success Criteria (if applicable):*

        1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) (Level A)


        More details can be found at [Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded.html). 


        **Issue ID: cr_captions_missing**

        *Definition*

        Synchronized captions are not provided for video or other multimedia content that contains audio. 

        *User Impact*

        Users who are deaf or hard of hearing will not have access to important information conveyed in audio. Captions also provide an enhanced experience for users with cognitive differences such as ADHD or learning disabilities. Additionally, captions are useful in certain situations such as environments with loud background noise or situations where sound is not allowed (e.g. the library without headphones, or near a sleeping baby).

        *Recommendation*

        Provide captions for all important audio information in video and multimedia content.

        *Success Criterion*

        1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) (Level A)

        *Related Success Criteria (if applicable):*

        2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A) <br />
        1.1.1 Non-text Content (Level A)

        This API uses machine learning models and inspects whether the text below each heading is related to the heading content or not. It covers the following Issue IDs:
        
        **Issue ID: cr_heading_unrelated**

        *Definition*

        The content immediately following a heading identified by machine learning is possibly unrelated to the topic or purpose. 

        *User Impact*

        Blind screen reader users rely on headings to navigate page content. When headings are misleading and do not reflect the topic or purpose, users can become disoriented and have difficulty navigating the page. Users with learning differences may also have difficulty understanding page content when headings are unrelated to content.

        *Recommendation*

        Provide clear and descriptive headings that accurately describe the immediatley following content.

        *Success Criterion*

        2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)

        *Related Success Criteria (if applicable):*

        1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)
